# model-explorer

**Model Explorer** is a dual-pane file browser for 3D STL files, designed to help users navigate directories and preview 3D models. The project is currently in development with the goal of offering basic file management functionality and 3D model visualization.

## Features (Planned)
- Dual-pane file browsing similar to Total Commander.
- Thumbnails for 3D STL files with a preview pane for model rotation.
- Basic file management: copy, move, rename, delete files and folders.
- Support for modular UI and STL loading via **Qt** and **ASSIMP**.

## Prerequisites
- **CMake** (minimum version 3.16)
- **vcpkg** for managing dependencies
- **Qt** (5.15 or later)
- **ASSIMP** for loading 3D models
- **Google Test** (gtest) for unit testing
